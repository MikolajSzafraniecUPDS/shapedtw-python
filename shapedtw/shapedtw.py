    -----------

    For univariate time series the flow of algorithm looks exactly the
    same as described in the referenced paper by Zhao and Itti available
    here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01601.pdf.

    As a first step time series is transformed to the matrix of subsequences
    (temporal points and their neighbours). Width of subsequences can be
    determined with 'subsequence_width' parameter. For subsequence_width=1
    we've got a subsequence of total length 3 observations
    (temporal point + one preceding neighbour + one following
    neighbour). For subsequence_width=2 we've got a subsequence of total length
    5 observations (temporal point + two precedings neighbours + one following
    neighbours). In case of temporal points at the beginning and at the end
    of time series we pad first and, respectively, last temporal points.

    As a next step we calculate shape descriptor for each of the subsequences.
    Shape descriptor is determined by the 'shape_descriptor' parameter. It can
    be both simple and compound descriptor.

    Finally, distance matrix between shape descriptors is calculated and passed
    to the 'dtw' function from the dtw-python package (detailed information about
    the project: https://dynamictimewarping.github.io/). It determines a warping
    path, which - usually, according to Zhao and Itti paper - is more relevant than
    warping path determined based on raw time series values. Please keep in mind that
    distance calculated by 'dtw' function in such a case is a distance between shape
    descriptors of query and reference time series. It can be used - for example - to
    find the nearest neighbour of given time series. However, one might prefer to use
    distance between raw time series values, calculated using warping path determined
    by shape dtw algorithm. For this purpose also such distance is reconstructed in
    the postprocessing phase.

    -----------

    As for multivariate time series we developed a fusion of the shape dtw algorithm
    and the concept presented in the paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5668684/.
    It means, that we can apply shape dtw algorithm for multivariate time series using
    both dependent and independent version of multivariate dtw.

    For multivariate dependent shape dtw there is one common warping paths
    for all time series dimensions. As a first step we calculate shape descriptors
    for all the dimensions individually and then determine single, common distance matrix
    using all the shape descriptors.

    For multivariate independent shape dtw distance matrices between shape descriptors
    are calculated independently for each time dimension; the same stands for warping paths.
    Afterward, distances for all dimensions are summed up -  as being said in the
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5668684/ paper:
    ,,DTW Independet is the cumulative distances of all dimensions independently measured under DTW".
