    According to Zhao and Itti concept so-called shape descriptors are the basis of the shape DTW algorithm. They allow us to
    transform subsequence of given time series to a vector of values representing it's local shape. Shape DTW algorithm uses shape
    descriptors instead of raw time series values to calculate optimal warping path.

    There are a few shape descriptors described in the Zhao and Itti paper and one can define his own descriptor.
    ShapeDescriptor is an abstract class, intended to be a parent class for all of the shape descriptors. It forces
    to implement a 'get_shape_descriptor' method, transforming a given time series chunk to its shape descriptor.
